# Paddy Doctor Project
Diseases and pests severely affect paddy farming and lead to as much as 70% loss in the total yield. Expert supervision is usually required to mitigate these diseases. With the limited availability of crop protection experts, manual disease identification is a tedious task. Thus, to add a solution to this problem, it is necessary to automate the disease identification process and provide easily accessible decision support tools to enable effective crop protection measures. However, the lack of public datasets with detailed disease information limits the practical implementation of automated disease detection systems leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques.
